Hi. I'm Shane, a software developer who enjoys building small tools that solve real-world problems — especially the ones I encounter or notice in everyday life.

While I’m comfortable working across the full stack, I gravitate toward backend development. I like working through repetitive or complex problems and turning them into clean, reliable systems. For example, I built [DutyPark](https://github.com/ShanePark/dutypark), a full-featured scheduling web app to help my wife manage her rotating shifts. It's one of my favorite personal projects, with features like calendar sharing, LLM-based event parsing, and team scheduling.

Other tools I've made include:

- [PSH](https://github.com/ShanePark/psh), a CLI tool that streamlines testing LeetCode-style problems.
- [FoodBox](https://github.com/ArgonetDevStudio/foodbox), a lunch menu notifier for my team.
- [Tashudoko](https://github.com/ArgonetDevStudio/tashudoko), a shared bike availability tracker.
- [Tistory CLS Checker](https://github.com/ShanePark/tistory_cls_checker), for checking layout shifts across all blog pages.
- [Table Parser](https://github.com/ShanePark/table-parser), to convert HTML tables to Excel.

At work, I develop research data lifecycle management tools. Most notably, I worked on NARDA, a research data platform developed at KISTI.

I value clarity and maintainability in code. I aim to keep things as simple and tidy as possible, removing unnecessary complexity wherever I can. Documentation is just as important to me as the code itself — I put care into writing readable README files, keeping wikis up to date, and using issues effectively. I also pay close attention to user feedback and iterate based on it.

Outside of work, I regularly write on my [technical blog](https://shanepark.tistory.com), mainly to document what I've learned and solve for others what I once found confusing. I also enjoy algorithm problems and used to participate in [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/u/shane-park) contests, though I’ve stepped back recently due to concerns about fairness in the age of coding AIs.

Thanks for stopping by.
